# Contatct_Tracing
**Using DBSCAN Algorithm
**
Contact tracing is the name of the process used to identify those who come into contact with people who have tested positive for communicable diseases â€“ such as measles, HIV and COVID-19. During a pandemic, proper contact tracing can help reduce the number of infected people or speed up the process of treating those infected. This can help save many lives.

Clustering is a subclass of machine learning algorithms used to divide data that share certain characteristics in different clusters based on those characteristics.

For contact tracing, we need to use a density-based clustering algorithm. The reason for this is that diseases are transferred when an infected person comes into contact with others. Thus, more congested - dense - areas will have more cases than less congested ones.
